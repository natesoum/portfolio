# Description
What was your motivation?
    My motivation was to test my knowledge(at this point) to display my skills to future employers. This includes structure of an HTML file and all things CSS. This is ranging from basic styles, flexbox & making my website responsive. I will definitely revisit this page and update when I become more comfortable and more knowledgable on these skills to truly display my passion for SWE and creative mindset! I hope you will continue to keep an eye for my portfolio page as it will get better with time! 

Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
    I built this project to test myself, this was not an easy task at all. I will definitely attempt to re-build this page from scratch to make certain skills "stick" better. Building this website has helped tremendously with understanding core concepts of HTML & CSS that I have learned at this point. 

What did you learn?
    I learned a lot! I learned how to properly build a webpage from scratch with proper semantic HTML & gave me a ton of practice with CSS! I got more familiar with CSS styling! This project helped me learn how to build a website mobile-first as compared to desktop-first. It helped me create an approach towards making a website, which doesn't include any coding. Breaking down problems to the smallest chunk possible is what made me progress the most! Even though a website requires a lot of coding, I understand that your approach and mindset that comes when coming across a problem is what truly solves and coding issues you come across! I hope to build on this skill even more, while learning all that I can! 

What makes your project stand out?
    I believe my project stands out because this website shows my skills at this point in time! Overtime, I will build upon my skills, hone them & become more and more advanced as time goes on. I will most likely revisit this page, if not. I will recreate this page and use this page to see how much I've grown as a Developer. I will remember the struggles & how long it took me to build this webpage. Knowing this, I hope to improve in every aspect when I do revisit/recreate this page. Thank you for reviewing my page & I hope you revisit in the future! 

# Comments
Overall, this was a great assignment to test my abilities. It was very challenging. I had very minor errors that took the longest amount of times. I guess this is the struggles of any Developer. As I continue to code, I begin to take a slower approach everytime to make my mistakes to a minimum. I got caught up in my studies & creating comments to truly understand properties, that at the time I was not able to create the webpage I envisioned, but this is a lesson learned and that I will always remember. Happy Coding!
